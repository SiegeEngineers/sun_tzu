Selection of Monks:
    Select a monk and hold down the "Ctrl" key.

Assigning to Control Groups:
    While holding "Ctrl," press a number key (e.g., 1) to assign the selected monk to that control group.
    Repeat the process for other monks, using different number keys (e.g., 2, 3, 4).

Unit Deployment:
    Send the grouped monks forward towards the target area.

Efficient Unit Selection:
    Utilize the assigned number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) to select and control specific monk groups.

Simultaneous Conversions:
    By using control groups, you can efficiently convert about four units simultaneously.
