Goal of Scouting:
    Identify four key elements: resource whereabouts, terrain, enemy whereabouts, and enemy activity.

Scouting Efficiency:
    Place the scout in a control group for quick selection (Ctrl + number).
    Use waypoints (Shift + right-click) to predetermine a scouting route.

Resource Prioritization:
    Focus on finding your own resources before locating the enemy.

Scout Survival:
    Keep your scout alive; it's a valuable asset throughout the game.
    The scout can reinforce your military early in the game.

Waypoint Caution:
    Be mindful not to rely too heavily on waypoints to avoid unintentional risks.
