Hey guys, Spirit Of The Law here. In this video, I want to address a really common question from people just picking up Age of Empires 2. I'll discuss a few schools of thought and the rationale behind each. It's crucial to emphasize that decisions made in the game are much more important than which civ you pick. However, specializing in one or two civilizations initially while learning core skills is a good idea.

New players tend to lean towards playing defensively and relying on the unique unit, regardless of the situation. Naturally, some popular choices for new players are the Byzantines and Teutons. Byzantines are designed as a defensive civilization, offering bonuses like cheaper halberdiers, skirmishers, and camels. The Teutons' unique unit, the Teutonic Knight, performs well in battles without micromanagement due to its high melee armor.

Another popular choice for new players is the Britons, known for their massable longbows. They provide a clear game plan of going for archers, simplifying decision-making, and having a good early to mid-game economy.

Some players opt for the "best civs" â€“ those with the highest win percentages. According to Voobly stats, the Franks, Slavs, and Indians were top choices for under 1500-rated players. However, civilizations like Malians, Huns, and Persians were favored in the bottom 1% of games played.

Another school of thought suggests that new players should go for civilizations with the most techs in the late game. Spanish, with a diverse tech tree, is considered a good choice. Byzantines and Saracens, with open tech trees and defensive play styles, also fall into this category.

On the contrary, some argue that the best new player civilizations are those with the greatest advantage in the early game. The Huns, Lithuanians, and Incas are mentioned, as they offer strong Dark Ages and a smooth transition into the game.

It's crucial to balance the desire for a strong early game with the goal of long-term improvement. Learning on civilizations with an easy early game may make other civs feel weaker, hindering your overall progress. The argument for trying them all is to focus on executing strategies, adapting, and reading game situations, skills that take time to develop.

Ultimately, the civilization you have the most fun playing is likely the one to go with. Trying various civilizations along the way can help you find the one that suits your playstyle. Personally, I went through phases with Byzantines, Mayans, and Huns but eventually settled on Japanese for most of my early rated games on HD because they felt the most enjoyable for me.

Remember, the goal is to have fun and continuously improve, so don't hesitate to experiment with different civilizations until you find your preferred playstyle.
