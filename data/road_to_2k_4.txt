Hello everyone, and welcome back to part 2 of the Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition series. About a year and a half ago, I released the initial part of this series on Voobly, which gained a lot of traction on YouTube. Due to popular demand, here's the updated part, and I'll be releasing these once a week on YouTube. We're currently at 1300 ELO, and I have some valuable tips for you. So, let's dive into the game.

At the 1300 ELO level, it's crucial to focus on refining your build order, adapting to different situations, and improving your micro skills. Dark Age and Feudal Age are the foundations of your gameplay, and you should aim for a clean and efficient execution of your basic build order. Scouting is also vital, as it helps you adapt to your opponent's strategies and react accordingly.

Now, let's talk about the specific strategy for 1300 ELO. We'll be using Ethiopians, focusing on mixing in Men-at-Arms before transitioning into archers. This approach helps to buy time and avoid being countered directly by skirmishers. Utilize this variation to add some spice to your standard archer build.

Before delving into the game, ensure your Dark Age is clean, and your scouting is effective. You should know the location of your resources, including gold, stone, and wood lines, to adapt efficiently in case of early rushes from your opponent.

In the game, make sure to shape your walls in the Feudal Age, adapting to potential aggression. The Men-at-Arms should provide early pressure and disrupt your opponent's economy. Proper micro is crucial during this stage, and remember to focus on single-unit targets to maximize damage.

As you transition to archers, continue scouting, and adapt your strategy based on your opponent's moves. Use control groups effectively to manage your military units and production buildings. Always be aware of your opponent's upgrades, as this information guides your decisions in engagements.

Maintaining aggression while macroing at home is a key skill. Expand your economy, add more farms, and ensure a smooth transition to Castle Age. Walling and map control become increasingly important, and proper micro will help you gain an edge in battles.

In Castle Age, focus on adding Town Centers strategically, expanding your economy, and preparing for further military advancements. Remember to adapt your strategy based on the specific strengths and weaknesses of your chosen civilization.

This aggressive Men-at-Arms into archers strategy is powerful at the 1300 ELO level. Mastering this approach will not only secure victories but also improve your overall gameplay. Continue practicing, and you'll see positive results in your journey through the rankings. Good luck!
