In this quick video, I'll demonstrate practical quick-walling techniques, especially since many pros make it look easy. Knowing the various quick-walling options and understanding how pros do it is crucial. I'm making this video ahead of my Best of 21 match against DauT, scheduled for June 6th and 7th with a $1,000 prize pool. Shameless plug: catch the action on my Twitch channel, twitch.tv/hera (link in the description).

To start, having a grid in the background is crucial for efficient quick-walling. I use a light grid mod, and the idea is to recognize that multiple units can occupy a single tile. Proper placement on the edge of a tile is key for quick double walls. Hotkeys for building placement should also be set up efficiently.

Now, consider the variety of buildings available for quick-walling: 3x3, 4x4, 2x2, and 1x1. The trick is understanding the corner of the tile for optimal placement. You can quickly place buildings at the corner of a tile, allowing for versatile combinations like market into palace sidewall into a house, and so on.

When dealing with an enemy, quickly place two palisade walls and finish the walling from a safe distance. Running away diagonally makes it harder for the enemy to disrupt your quick-walling process. Viper popularized the technique of holding the first quick-wall, making it faster and smoother.

To showcase an example, quick-walling in the middle is slower than on the sides. Utilizing the grid, you can easily fix mistakes and reinforce the wall. Despite interruptions from the enemy, understanding the grid and the corner placement allows for quick adjustments and effective quick-walling.
