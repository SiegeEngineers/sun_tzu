Hello everyone, welcome back to part 2 of this series. Today, we're looking at recorded games from a viewer, SkillYourself, who's a big supporter of the Age of Empires community. Let's dive into the first replay against Darth Vader.

We start with a scouting analysis. SkillYourself attempts an advanced build, but there are a few inefficiencies. He scouts well initially but makes a small slip-up with the boar. The opponent, playing as Magyars, is expected to go scouts. However, SkillYourself wastes time scouting his opponent's base.

Moving to the Feudal Age, SkillYourself encounters some idle scouting issues, but overall, his build is decent. The opponent seems to be planning scouts, and SkillYourself responds accordingly. The game unfolds with skirmishes, and SkillYourself's micro stands out. Despite losing a few villagers, he adapts well.

Entering the Castle Age, SkillYourself is ahead due to a more efficient boom. He handles a siege push and fights well, showcasing good micro. The opponent is limited to one TC, giving SkillYourself a significant economic advantage.

As the game progresses, SkillYourself maintains control, making a few mistakes like fighting downhill. However, he overwhelms his opponent with a superior army and takes the win.

In summary, SkillYourself displays improvement, but there are areas to refine, such as scouting and cleaner execution of builds. Stay tuned for the next episode as we continue to analyze SkillYourself's gameplay. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next episode!
