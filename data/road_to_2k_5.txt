Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of our definitive edition series on Voobly. About a year and a half ago, I received a lot of positive feedback on YouTube, and many people have been asking for an updated version, so here we are. Today, we're aiming for 1400 elo, and for those watching on YouTube, these episodes will be uploaded once a week to the channel. Thank you all for your support in advance. Now, let's dive right into it. If you think this is cringe, remember that gameplay matters more, so let's focus on improving together.

In the previous episode, we covered scouts and transitioning to skirmishers. Today, we'll continue our focus on micro, improving our game, and expanding our economy. We'll be adding more military production buildings in the Castle Age, exploring the sides of the map, picking up relics, and attacking our opponents from different angles.

Now, let's jump into a game and put these strategies into action. We'll be using the Magyars, focusing on scouts and transitioning into skirmishers, which will remain effective even in the Imperial Age with upgrades like Bracer. The plan is to showcase verbal lessons in action as we play.

I've already explained the dark age basics in previous episodes, such as scouting with sheep and efficiently gathering resources. The key is to have a consistent dark age, ensuring you scout your opponent's map as quickly as possible. Today, we'll be adapting our scout strategy to incorporate skirmishers in the Feudal Age to counter opponents using spearmen.

As we progress, we want to find opportunities to attack our opponent, similar to the minute arms strategy from the last episode. Efficiency in gathering resources and building placement is crucial. We'll focus on walling our base and making the necessary buildings.

Clicking up to the Feudal Age should be consistent, and we'll continue the standard build with houses, barracks, and a stable. The goal is to hit our opponent at vulnerable spots, and we'll focus on walling efficiently at home.

Now, let's discuss the advantages of having skirmishers in the Feudal Age. They provide a solid defense against spearmen and archers, helping us survive and deal more damage than just scouts. The skirmishers act as a bridge to reach Castle Age, where we'll transition to knights.

Knights will become our primary unit in Castle Age, and skirmishers will serve a supportive role. The scouts, with their mobility, can continue to snipe units and harass the opponent.

As we advance to late Castle Age, we'll start expanding on the map, picking up relics with monks, and adding outposts for better vision. This strategic map control is essential to our long-term success.

Our main focus now is on knight production and resource management. Spending resources efficiently is critical, and we want to maintain pressure on our opponent. We'll also explore additional gold and stone spots on the map.

By this point, we should be transitioning to Imperial Age. We'll continue expanding, adding town centers, and securing resources strategically. Outposts and monks will help us gain more map control.

As we prepare to click up to Imperial Age, we'll sell excess resources and maintain a constant knight production. The goal is to keep our opponent under pressure, exploiting weaknesses, and securing the win.

In Imperial Age, we can further invest in upgrades, and our focus will shift towards maintaining a strong economy. With knights still being produced, we aim to force our opponent's resignation.

Remember to keep a keen eye on the mini-map for strategic advancements, and continue scouting the map for potential expansion opportunities.

As we approach the end of the game, our economic advantage and map control should secure victory. This episode focused on micro and strategic map control, showcasing how these elements can contribute to a successful game.

Thank you for joining me in this episode, and I'll see you next week for the 1500 elo challenge. Peace!
