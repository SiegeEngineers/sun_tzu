Welcome to the discussion of strategy, a more subjective aspect of gameplay that involves making better strategic choices based on greater knowledge and adaptability. Unlike macro, strategy involves subjective decision-making, where factors like getting housed are situational. The focus is on how to collect and process information to derive your own answers.

Strategy takes time to master, relying on accumulated game knowledge. Examples include deciding when to fight skirmishers with archers or when to engage a crossbowman ball with knights. Strategies fall into prepared (planned before the game) and reactive (adaptation during the game) categories.

Civilization matchups play a vital role. Knowing what each civ is capable of is crucial. Experience, random civ selections, and scouting contribute to this knowledge. Scouting involves understanding common things like predicting opponent actions, hills, attack paths, resources, relics, and upgrades.

Predictability matters; opponents can make predictions based on what you reveal. However, unconventional strategies can work occasionally. The key is asking questions and experimenting. Game knowledge is crucial for adapting to the current state of the game.

Scouting is crucial for reacting effectively. Reactive decisions, like countering tower rushes or adjusting to an opponent's faster Castle Age, require adaptability. Game knowledge enables swift reactions, such as knowing how to counter specific units or upgrades.

Adapting to the game state involves reacting to your opponent's moves. If your opponent gets to Castle Age faster, focus on defense and economy. Avoid mirroring their strategy; instead, strive to disrupt their plans. Taking map control involves walling, having mobile forces, placing castles strategically, and securing resources outside your base.

Map presence is vital; it means controlling an area actively. Outposts, buildings, and scouting contribute to map presence. High mobility units, scouting, and active units on the map are essential for gaining and maintaining control. Knowing your opponent's actions allows you to formulate a strategy to counter them.

In conclusion, strategy requires constant adaptation, informed decisions, and a deep understanding of the game. It involves both preparation and reactive decision-making, with an emphasis on using game knowledge to outsmart opponents.
