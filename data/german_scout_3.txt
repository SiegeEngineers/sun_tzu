**Scouting Safety on Standard Maps (e.g., Arabia):**

1. **Safe Wood Line Hugging:**
   - Wood lines are safe as they never spawn within the enemy town center's range.
   - Knowing the general location is enough; detailed information about resources is not urgent.

2. **Priority on Essential Information:**
   - Focus on crucial info like enemy town center location and available resources.
   - The presence of collective food under the Town Center is assumed and not a priority.

3. **Safety Measures When Under Attack:**
   - If the scout is within the enemy town center's range and under attack:
     - Moving straight backward poses a higher risk.
     - Opt for diagonal or sideways movement to dodge arrows effectively.
