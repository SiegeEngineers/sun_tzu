## **RECOMMENDED MODS**
These mods either give you in-game knowledge or diminishes problems of efficiency brought from visual imperfections from the game.
All mods listed here are UHD Supported.


***Must Haves***
- **Anne_HK - Selected Small Trees with Grid Shadow** (drastically reduces the amount of holes in your walls, as well as decreasing chance of constructing your Lumber Camp too far away, which reduces efficiency)
Alternative: **Anne_HK - Identical Pine Trees with Grid Shadow**
- **No More Plants** (removes non-choppable plants, purely graphic - a few biomes have the straggler trees looking very much alike to graphical-only plants and then you realize you have a few idle villagers standing like idiots doing nothing)
- **Idle Villager Pointer (UHD supported)** (creates a big red ! above your villagers when they are idle so you never again will let a villager stand there doing nothing for a few centuries after a quick wall)
- **Anne_HK - Better Resource Panel and Idle Villager Icon** (changes the resource panel layout so numbers are more visible and completely changes the yellow small "Idle Villagers" icon into a bright red ribbon your blind granny could see from the other room)
- **Interactive Build Order Guide** (famous voiced scenarios for training build orders)


***Good Mods***
- **No Intro** (removes the useless intro videos so you can enter your game faster enough so you can play up to 2.27 games during your lunch break)
- **0xDB Map Color Clarity UI 2.0b** (this is a favorite of mine that makes resources on the map pop out more and make them easier to see)
- **Fish Borders** (creates a small border on fish resources for better visibility)
- **Anne_HK - Building Foundation Label (with Player Color)** (shows building icons on foundations so you know what's being built there)
- **[FrostyFriends] Main Menu** or any background menu mod (after an update you KNOW you need to reactivate your mods before entering a ranked match)
