**Top Things to Do with Starting Scout in AoE2 (Besides Scouting):**

1. **Monk Harass (Top Priority):**
   - Use the scout to target and kill enemy monks trying to fetch relics early in the game.
   - Disrupting relic collection provides a significant trade of value for you.

2. **Harass Villagers (Especially Near Walls or Houses):**
   - Target lone villagers near the periphery of the opponent's base.
   - Create idle time and potentially hinder their early-game economy.

3. **Blocking Units:**
   - Block enemy units, especially during boar lures.
   - Prevent damage to your boar luring villager or hinder enemy units from escaping.

4. **Boar Luring (Efficiency on Water or Closed Maps):**
   - Use the scout to block boars, optimizing economy efficiency.
   - Valuable on water maps or closed maps where scout HP is less critical.

5. **Deer Pushing (Versatile and Valuable):**
   - Push deer for a more efficient economy, particularly in greedy build orders or team games.
   - Sacrifice some early scouting for long-term economic benefits.

**Note:** Prioritize tasks based on the specific map, match, and strategy. These alternative uses of the starting scout contribute to strategic advantages beyond its primary scouting role.
