Hello, everyone, and welcome back! Today, we'll be covering the 1500 to 1600 Elo range, focusing on refining your ranked experience. In this phase, it's crucial to hone your skills, and I'll give you the tools to master them within the 200 Elo range. A quick disclaimer: the following are guidelines to help you improve, not rigid rules. Let's dive in and see what's in store for us today.

At this Elo range, dictating our strategy based on the map becomes paramount. We've covered archers, scouts, and militia arms before; now, we'll delve into adapting our strategy to the specific map rather than just the civilization matchup. It's about reading the game early on, utilizing power spikes, and controlling the hills in the Castle Age for strategic advantages.

Map control is key; we'll explore placing forward buildings strategically, especially in the opponent's base, to apply pressure. Constant harassment and effective control of the map's sides are crucial, emphasizing quality trades and smart army compositions in the late game.

Now, let's get into the specifics. As always, start with two houses and explore your base. Assess your map and civilization matchup, considering whether archers or scouts are more suitable. I'll use the Vikings as an example, a civ that excels in archers but can also handle scouts. The decision between archers and scouts is influenced by both your map and the civ matchup.

For instance, if your map favors archers, exploit that advantage. If you can back your gold and use natural walls effectively, archers might be a solid choice. However, if your map is better suited for scouts, adapt accordingly. This decision is crucial around the 2:30 mark.

Proceed with the standard build, emphasizing efficient walling and scouting. Adjust your strategy based on what your opponent is doing; if they're not fully walled, consider investing more in scouts. Remember, surprise and adaptability are key at this Elo range.

As you progress, scout the entire map, not just your opponent's base. This reveals extra resources like relics, providing a long-term advantage. Keep adapting and pressuring your opponent, making strategic decisions to control the game.

Once you hit Castle Age, consider going forward with siege to gain map control. Siege workshops on hills or strategic locations can put immense pressure on your opponent. Use this advantage to control the game, expanding your economy while keeping the pressure on.

As you approach the Imperial Age, focus on maintaining map control, adapting your economy, and applying pressure from multiple angles. Keep refining your playstyle, and remember, it's not just about winning but showcasing a solid and adaptable strategy.

In the end, these verbal tips are best demonstrated in practical games. Practice with AI opponents or real players to refine your skills. Good luck, and let's continue improving together!
