For new players, the emphasis is on learning the basics and exploring strategies through campaigns. AI opponents at various difficulties provide a stepping stone before venturing into online play. Hotkeys are introduced gradually, starting with fundamental commands such as building houses and farms.

Transitioning to online matches, the advice is to keep it simple, beginning with 1v1 games. The focus shifts to four distinct stages: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age, and Imperial Age. In the Dark Age, players learn eco building placements, basic scouting, and upgrade strategies. Choosing one or two civilizations to master is recommended to avoid overwhelming complexity.

Hotkey usage expands as the player becomes more comfortable. In the Feudal Age, attention is drawn to building a barracks and a stable, with the goal of reaching Castle Age for knights. Prioritizing armor upgrades for knights and dealing with early attacks through efficient town center usage is key.

Economic expansion becomes crucial in the Castle Age, with the addition of a second town center to boost production. The plan remains straightforward, focusing on aspects like making knights and steady base upgrades.

In summary, the approach is to take the game step by step, learning at one's own pace. Focus on key concepts such as eco upgrades, military production, and scouting, gradually adding complexity to gameplay. A simple yet focused plan, combined with steady adjustments, is the key to progressing from 1000 yellow elo and below.
