Hello everyone, and welcome back to 2K Definitive Edition. In this session, we'll be looking to advance from 100 to 1200 ELO as we continue our journey up the ranked ladder. Last time, we explored the archery builder with archers into scouts into knights. Today, we'll delve into another civilization to broaden our understanding. As mentioned earlier, the goal is to focus on two or three specific civilizations, with one being a cavalry-centric choice and another an archer-focused one. This approach helps in mastering build orders more effectively.

Now, let's jump right into it. We're aiming for 1200 ELO this time, and I have some tips similar to those for the 1100 ELO players. Continuously refine your Dark Age, perfect your Dark Age start, and learn a different builder, such as scouts into knights. Improving in the Feudal Age is crucial, so focus on spending your resources wisely. Finally, transition to the Imperial Age, reach 200 population, and optimize your hotkeys for enhanced gameplay. Keep in mind that having a specific set of civilizations makes the learning process smoother.

For today's gameplay, we'll be focusing on a strong cavalry civilization that lacks Paladins. Magyars are a solid choice due to their straightforward gameplay and the flexibility to play with archers. Other options include Spanish, Tuetons, Slavs, Lithuanians, Huns, and Franks. Magyars, in particular, are excellent with the scouts builder, benefiting from free attack upgrades and cheaper scouts.

As we start the game, make villagers, lure in the sheep, and consider scouting with the sheep to expedite early exploration. I've got a surprise for you todayâ€”a detailed guide from Dark Age to early Castle Age, outlining the crucial build orders. Subscribing to the Twitch channel and following on YouTube will give you access to these guides. It's essential to know where to find them for your improvement.

Moving on to Dark Age and Feudal Age strategies, focus on walling with houses to ensure protection against potential archer attacks. Walling becomes more critical when going for scouts into knights, as they are vulnerable to archer retaliation. Efficiency in walling is key, and shaping your walls with houses is a strategic move. Learn to adapt and optimize your economy, keeping an eye on key resources.

As we progress through the Feudal Age, create a balanced economy and start attacking with scouts. The goal is to harass your opponent and buy time for your transition to Castle Age. Patrol your scouts, and when it comes to lumber camps, split villagers to avoid congestion. Efficient lumber camp management is crucial for smooth resource gathering.

The transition to Castle Age involves setting up a stable and preparing for upgrades. Remember to split your eco upgrades between the lumber camp and mill efficiently. Walling continues to be important, and you can use your scouts to scout the opponent's base. Adapt to the situation, and when facing enemy spears, use your scouts' mobility to your advantage.

As you hit Castle Age, prioritize getting upgrades, making units, and setting up town centers. Expand your economy strategically, and consider adding a second stable for increased knight production. The key is to apply consistent pressure on your opponent while reinforcing your base.

In Castle Age, make use of your mobility advantage with knights, and gradually work towards a 200-population setup. Allocate resources wisely, focusing on village and knight production, and invest in essential economy upgrades. As you advance through the ranks, this approach should yield positive results.

Feel free to experiment with one-town center strategies at lower ELOs, focusing on a stronger economy with a single town center. However, transitioning to two-town center strategies and castles will provide a more solid foundation for long-term success.

I hope you found these insights valuable. Stay tuned for the next episode as we continue our journey. Good luck on the battlefield!
