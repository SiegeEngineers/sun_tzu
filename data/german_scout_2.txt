**Locating Enemy Town Center in Age of Empires II:**

1. **Mini-Map Observation:**
   - Enemy Town Center often positioned symmetrically opposite to your own on the mini-map.

2. **Scouting Strategy:**
   - After finding your resources, send your scout to locate the enemy.
   - Micro-manage each waypoint near their base, avoiding direct paths.

3. **Control Group Usage:**
   - Utilize control groups for precise scouting, minimizing risks.
   - Avoid the risk of the scout immediately reaching the enemy Town Center.

4. **Priority Targets:**
   - Look for satellite resources or other enemy buildings first.
   - Spot significant resources like gold, stone piles, or large forage bushes.

5. **Resource Deduction:**
   - Identify a gold or stone pile (4 tiles or more) to deduce the enemy Town Center's location accurately.
