**Preventing and Managing Floating Resources in AoE2:**

1. **Floating Resources Defined:**
   - Resources accumulate when gathered but not spent, leading to a stockpile.
   - Known as "floating."

2. **Value of Unspent Resources:**
   - Unspent resources are essentially worthless.
   - The net value of a working villager equals that of an idle villager if resources remain unused.

3. **Preventing Floating Resources:**
   - Distribute villagers evenly based on current needs.
   - Avoid concentrating too many villagers on a single resource.

4. **Remedying Floating Resources:**
   - Use the market to buy and sell resources for balancing.
   - Spend surplus resources strategically to avoid float.

5. **Balancing Villager Distribution:**
   - Redistribute villagers to balance resource gathering and prevent accumulation.

6. **Example Scenario:**
   - If floating wood, reassign villagers to new farms.
   - Simultaneously redistributes villagers and utilizes surplus wood.

**Note:** Efficiently managing and spending resources is crucial to prevent resource float, ensuring optimal economic performance in AoE2.
