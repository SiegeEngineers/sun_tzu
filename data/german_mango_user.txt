    Powerful Siege Unit:
        Effective against archers and enemy units.

    Friendly Fire Issue:
        Mangonel can damage your own units.
        Option 1: Set it to no attack stance.
        Preferred: Set it to stand ground and keep it out of range from your units.

    Attack Ground Technique:
        Use attack ground to target a specific point where enemies are present but no friendlies.
        Ensures the mangonel fires against attacking units without moving.

    Ballistics Effect:
        Mangonel lacks ballistics effect.
        Predict the enemy's movement by using attack ground to time the impact with their position.

    Precision Shots:
        To ensure effective hits on moving targets, use attack ground to align with the enemy's anticipated position.

    Consider Input Delay:
        Account for input delay to time attacks accurately.

Note: Implement these strategies to maximize the mangonel's efficiency while minimizing the risk of friendly fire.
