In this video, the content creator discusses how to play Black Forest in Age of Empires 2, focusing on team games. Here are the key points:

1. **Map Overview:**
   - Black Forest is characterized by dense forests covering almost the entire map.
   - Players spawn in areas with land suitable for developing their economies.
   - Chokepoints created by the forests become strategic locations.

2. **Team Game Strategies:**
   - Flanks focus on controlling early-game chokepoints by walling them up quickly.
   - Pockets support flanks by scouting with their starting Scout and then transitioning into a fast Castle Age and booming.

3. **Resource Elements:**
   - Extra boars are often found and are crucial for early-game food. Players either lure them to the Town Center or make a Mill to collect the food.
   - Ponds within the forests can provide additional resources if players choose to build docks and fish.

4. **Chokepoint Strategies:**
   - Early control of chokepoints is essential for dictating the flow of the game.
   - Walls at the chokepoints create a strategic advantage, allowing players to control the map.
   - Chokes serve as defensive positions and can be walled strategically to limit the opponent's options.

5. **Sneaky Villager Strategy:**
   - Some players may attempt a sneaky villager strategy, sending villagers to the opponent's side early in the game.
   - This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can disrupt opponents if successful.

6. **Flank vs. Pocket Strategies:**
   - Flanks are advised to focus on early rushes or strategic plays to disrupt opponents.
   - Pockets prioritize booming and building a strong late-game army to carry the team.

7. **Late-Game Unit Choices:**
   - Recommended late-game units include those with high power, such as Siege units, monks with range upgrades, Paladins, elephants, or unique units with strong capabilities.
   - Establishing trade routes early helps sustain the production of these powerful units.

8. **Trade and Economy:**
   - Setting up trade early is crucial for a continuous flow of gold.
   - With sufficient trade, players can afford powerful late-game units without worrying about gold shortages.

9. **Pro Tips:**
   - Walling behind the choke or conceding the wall early can be a strategic decision based on the opponent's actions.
   - Late game, use outposts and Town Patrol across the woodline to detect enemy siege movement.
   - Consider having a large number of villagers (up to 80) and then deleting some to make space for trade carts.
